# SaberStream

A set of various tools that I wrote to be used when I [livestream Beat Saber on my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/macyler). There's a bunch of different functions all integrated here, so this is most likely only useful to others as reference.

Not meant for general use by others, hence no binary downloads are provided.
