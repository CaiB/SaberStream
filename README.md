# SaberStream

A set of various tools that I wrote to be used when I [livestream Beat Saber on my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/macyler). There's a bunch of different functions all integrated here, so this is most likely only useful to others as reference.

Not meant for general use by others, hence no binary downloads are provided.

SteamVR's poor reliability and performance has caused me to lose interest in VR, hence I sold my hardware and no longer play Beat Saber. As such, this repository is archived and unmaintained.
